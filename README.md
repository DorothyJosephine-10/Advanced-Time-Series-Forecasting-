📘 Advanced Time Series Forecasting with Neural Networks and Explainable AI (XAI)

This project implements a complete end-to-end pipeline for multivariate time series forecasting using LSTM neural networks combined with Explainable AI (XAI) techniques such as SHAP.
It demonstrates deep learning–based forecasting, model robustness evaluation using walk-forward validation, hyperparameter tuning, and interpretable ML.

The goal is to forecast future values of a multivariate time-dependent signal and understand why the model makes its predictions.

🔥 Key Features
✔ Multivariate Time Series Dataset

Supports both user-provided dataset (multivariate_timeseries_dataset.csv) and synthetic data generation.

Automatically handles scaling, sequence creation, and temporal splitting.

✔ Deep Learning Forecasting (LSTM)

Single-layer LSTM with configurable units, dropout & dense layers.

Trained using Adam optimizer with MSE loss.

✔ Walk-Forward Cross-Validation

Evaluates model robustness over time, not shuffled data.

Computes:

RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)

MAE (Mean Absolute Error)

MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)

✔ Hyperparameter Search

Small grid search over:

LSTM units

Dense units

Dropout rate

Learning rate

✔ Explainable AI (SHAP)

Uses shap.DeepExplainer to compute temporal feature importance.

Produces global mean absolute SHAP ranking for all features.

✔ End-to-End Jupyter Notebook

Fully modular functions

Easy to read, modify, and extend
